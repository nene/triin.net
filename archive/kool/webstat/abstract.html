<h1 id="abstract">Abstract</h1>

<p>The purpose of this thesis was to investigate the usage of different
technologies in the web. A program was constructed, which gathered statistics
about (X)HTML, CSS and JavaScript used on web pages.</p>

<p>The program was run through one week and it gathered information from over
million web pages. The links in web directory <a href="http://dmoz.org/">Open
Directory Project</a> were used as a selection. All the gathered data was
stored into a MySQL database and was analyzed also in there.</p>

<p>The result of the work was a big set of data, which describes the situation
in the code used on web pages as of 2006. This data may be used in comparison
with future studies of the same subject. The most important results of the
analyzes were the following:</p>

<ul>
<li>67% of pages used CSS,</li>
<li>65% used JavaScript and</li>
<li>at least 10% used Flash.</li>
<li>2.6% of the (X)HTML used on pages was valid according to document type declaration
(which was a lot more than 0.7%, measured on a similar selection at 2001).</li>
<li>41% of CSS was correct according to the W3C CSS 2 recommendation.</li>
</ul>
