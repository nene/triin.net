<h1 id="program-for-analyzing-the-code-of-web-pages">Program for analyzing the code of web pages</h1>

<p>Of course, to analyze the code of all these pages, I needed a program
to automate the progress. I chose to write it in Perl, although it?s not
my first language, but it had a lot of great libraries avaliable for
parsing HTML and CSS. Most importantly I used the following:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://search.cpan.org/~gaas/HTML-Parser-3.54/Parser.pm">HTML::Parser</a>
from Gisle Aas ? a great tool for parsing real-world HTML.</li>
<li><a href="http://search.cpan.org/~bjoern/CSS-SAC-0.06/SAC.pm">CSS::SAC</a>
from Björn Höhrmann ? implementation of SAC (<a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/SAC">Simple
API for CSS</a>) in Perl.</li>
</ul>

<p>To validate (X)HTML i used <a title="WDG Validator"
href="http://www.htmlhelp.com/tools/validator/offline/index.html.en">offline
HTML validator</a> provided by Web Design Group (WDG). You might wonder why I
didn't use the well-known <a href="http://validator.w3.org">W3C Markup Validator</a>?
First of all Dagfinn Parnas, who?s research I?m trying to replicate as closely as
possible, used this validator, but also the WDG Validator is a way lot easier to
install into your computer.</p>

<p>As for CSS, there doesn?t seem to be no other validator available than the
<a href="http://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/">W3C CSS Validator</a>. I have to
say great thanks to Steve Ferguson, who made available a <a
href="http://www.illumit.com/css-validator/">precompiled version of the CSS
Validator</a> ? I tried several days to compile the validator by my own, but
didn?t succeed.</p>

<p>To store all the data to be gathered by the program, I created a MySQL
database with 38 tables. MySQL was used as this is the database I?m most
familiar with.</p>

<p>To retrieve the URI-s from web, I used the well-known GNU Wget.</p>

<p>All the Perl source code of the program is freely available for download
and licensed under the same terms as Perl itself (which means: feel free
to modify or do whatever you think, just don't do anything nasty). The
installation instructions are hidden into the following tarball inside
the file INSTALL:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="/2006/05/10/webstat.tar.gz">webstat.tar.gz</a> ? 8 MB
(includes W3C CSS Validator and WDG HTML Validator).</li>
</ul>

<p>Oh, and if you didn't guessed it already, you need Linux to run
the whole thing.</p>
