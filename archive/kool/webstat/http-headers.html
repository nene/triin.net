<h1 id="http-headers">HTTP headers</h1>

<p>Besides HTML, CSS and JavaScript the program also collected
data about HTTP headers. Sure, this data only reflects those headers
that are common on the front pages of websites, and as I said,
all the pages with other status code than 200 OK were removed
from further analyzes.</p>

<p>First of all, lets take a look at the very first line of any
HTTP response, typically something like this:</p>

<pre>HTTP/1.1 200 OK</pre>

<p><code>1.1</code> here designates the HTTP version number.
Version 1.1 is the most recent HTTP standard, 1.0 being the previous.
Anything below 1.0 is deprecated. As <a href="#figure-3">figure 3</a>
clearly shows, the situation in web regarding HTTP versions is sound:
97% of pages are served using the latest standard. Although I should
point out, that the program dismissed all the pages with HTTP version
below 1.0. Anyway, I’m quite sure that web browsers also don’t accept
anything below 1.0.</p>

<div class="joonis" id="figure-3">
<img src="/archive/kool/webstat/figure-3.png" alt="97.15% of pages uses HTTP version 1.1. Remaining 2.85% uses version 1.0." />
<p><span class="nr">Figure 3.</span>
HTTP versions. Majority of pages uses the latest HTTP version 1.1.</p></div>

<p>The following <a href="#figure-4">figure 4</a> shows 21 most frequently
used HTTP headers on web pages.</p>

<div class="joonis" id="figure-4">
<img src="/archive/kool/webstat/figure-4.png" alt="Content-type, date, server, connection, content-length, ..." />
<p><span class="nr">Figure 4.</span>
Most frequently used HTTP headers.</p></div>

<p>Of course 100% of pages have Content-Type header, because pages without
that were previously removed from the selection. I’ll discuss the usage of
Content-Type header later in the text, when I talk about the encodings
used.</p>

<p>The values of Date header are presumably uninteresting, but the Server
header provides a lot of information regarding which HTTP servers are
used. As can be seen from <a href="#figure-5">figure 5</a>, by far the
most popular HTTP server is Apache, followed by Microsoft Internet
Information Service.</p>

<div class="joonis" id="figure-5">
<img src="/archive/kool/webstat/figure-5.png" alt="Apatche, Microsoft-IIS, Zeus" />
<p><span class="nr">Figure 5.</span>
Three most popular HTTP servers (based on Server headers).</p></div>

<p>The previous figure is continued in <a href="#figure-6">figure 6</a>,
magnifying the usage of rarer servers. Note that these are just the
values of the Server header, not necessarily names of HTTP server
softwares. For example Rapidsite is actually a web hosting service
provider.</p>

<div class="joonis" id="figure-6">
<img src="/archive/kool/webstat/figure-6.png" alt="Zeus, Netscape-Enterprise, Rapidsite, Squeegit, Sun-one-web-server, Lotus-Domino, ..." />
<p><span class="nr">Figure 6.</span>
Lesser popular values of Server header (extension to the previous figure).</p></div>

<p>The fourth header, used on almost every page, is the Connection.
Aside from few quirks, all pages are served with either keep-alive
or close as values of this header. <a href="#figure-7">Figure 7</a>
shows, that the first value is used slightly more often than the
other.</p>

<div class="joonis" id="figure-7">
<img src="/archive/kool/webstat/figure-7.png" alt="Keep-Alive 58.71%, Close 41.29%" />
<p><span class="nr">Figure 7.</span>
Values for the Connection header.</p></div>

<p>But the HTTP headers statistics was not the main target of this
research, it could be described more as a side-result, although a
planned one. So, lets leave the HTTP protocol for now, and dive into
the markup itself.</p>
