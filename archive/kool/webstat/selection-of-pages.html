<h1 id="selection-of-pages">Selection of pages</h1>

<p>As I have already done several researches, harvesting the use of web standards
in Estonia and by the members of World Wide Web Consortium. (See:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="/2005/04/27/Web_Standards_in_Estonia">Web Standards in Estonia</a>,</li>
<li><a href="/2005/09/18/Web_Standards_in_Estonia_vol_2">Web Standards in Estonia vol 2</a>,</li>
<li><a href="/2006/03/11/Web_Standards_in_Estonia_vol_3">Web Standards in Estonia vol 3</a>,</li>
<li><a href="/2006/03/05/Validating_sites_of_W3C_members">Validating sites of W3C members</a>.)</li>
</ul>

<p>So it was natural, that this time I wanted to do something bigger. But the
big problem was: <strong>how do I collect a representative selection of all the
pages in the web?</strong> The solution almost accidentally fall into my hands,
when I found one study from 2001.</p>

<p>Apparently five years ago Dagfinn Parnas from Norway conducted a survey as
a part of he’s masters thesis (titled <a href="http://elsewhat.com/thesis/">How
to cope with invalid HTML</a>) to find out how many pages in the web are valid
according to their document type declaration. He validated over 2 million
<acronym title="Uniform Resourse Identifier">URI</acronym>-s, gathered by
the <a href="http://dmoz.org/">Open Directory Project</a> (which are freely
downloadable in <acronym title="Resource Description Framework">RDF</acronym>
format), and came to the conclusion, that only 0.7% of webpages use valid
HTML.</p>

<p>Five years have passed since then, and the face of the web has changed
quite a bit (see <a href="#figure-1">figure 1</a>). So I took the opportunity
to perform another research using the URI-s in Open Directory Project as a
selection and tools similar to the ones Dagfinn Parnas used – making available
a comparison between <em>the web</em> now and then.</p>
