<h1>Web Standards in Estonia vol 3</h1>

<div class="preambula">
<p>This survey continues the work done in previous surveys on
<a href="/2005/04/27/Web_Standards_in_Estonia">February 2005</a> and
<a href="/2005/09/18/Web_Standards_in_Estonia_vol_2">August 2005</a>.
Also, the recent work of
<a href="/2006/03/05/Validating_sites_of_W3C_members">Validating sites of
W3C members</a> (which uses the same methodology) might be of interest to you.</p>

<p>All the figures on this web page are also represented as tables. If you want
to see the tables, turn off the showing of images in your browser or view the
page with a text‐only browser. If you only see the tables, or don’t see neither
tables or figures, then it probably means your browser does not correctly

<h2 id="the-selection-of-pages">The selection of pages</h2>

<p>I acquired the set of Estonian web pages the same way as in
previous surveys: they’re all taken from
<a href="http://www.neti.ee/cgi-bin/serverid">Neti.ee Estonian servers list</a>.</p>

<p>Compared to the previous survey (done in August 2005), there
were 1290 more pages this time.</p>

<div class="tabel" id="table1">
<table summary="This table lists the surveys in chronological order
and shows how many pages took part of each survey, also how big was
the growth in number of pages between surveys">

</table>
<p><span class="nr">Table 1.</span> The number of pages that took
part from each of the Estonian-webpages-survey.</p>
</div>

<p>When we look at <a href="#table1">table 1</a>, we’ll see
there has been a significant growth in the number of pages used
in survey. From February to August (6 months) 830 more pages were
added to the list, but from August to March (7 months) <strong>4476</strong> pages
were added. That’s quite a difference! Probably it’s because the winter is the
active time of doing business (and also – it seems – buying domain
names).</p>

<p>From the full set of 27,211 pages 3186 pages were excluded for various
reasons (redirect to another page, no HTML content, error page etc),
which left us with 24,024 pages to perform validation and other kinds
of statistics on.</p>

<h2 id="results">Results</h2>

<p>The results of our previous survey were a bit disappointing (to say
the least). The number of valid pages had only risen by four and the
overall percentage of valid pages had fallen from 2.22% to 2.17%.</p>

<p>That fore I was quite surprised when I first saw the results
of this very survey. It looked like a miracle.</p>

<p>I checked everything twice, but it seems to be correct: <strong>the
amount of valid pages in Estonia has risen from 2.17% to 3.02%!</strong>
That’s almost 1% of growth! That’s almost 40% more valid pages!
The following <a href="#table2">table 2</a> provides you with hard numbers.</p>

<h2 id="document-types">Doctypes</h2>

<p>If previously 34.98% of invalid pages had doctype specified, then now it has
risen to <strong>35.54%</strong>. Minor change, but indeed.</p>

<p>The distribution of document types used in invalid and valid pages can be
seen from the following figures <a href="#figure1" title="Figure 1">1</a> and
<a href="#figure2" title="Figure 2">2</a>.</p>

<p><span class="nr">Figure 2.</span> Changes in the use of doctypes on valid pages.</p>
</div>

<p>The most significant change to note from both figures above: <strong>the usage of
XHTML 1.0 Transitional has almost doubled.</strong> Also the XHTML 1.0 Strict and
XHTML 1.1 have also nearly doubled they’re usage. This certainly is the sign that XHTML
is moving in the direction of becoming more popular than HTML (especially when creating
new webpages).</p>

<p>On the bad side of XHTML 1.1, which (according to W3C) <em>must not</em> be served as
<code>text/html</code>. But none of the valid pages, that used XHTML 1.1, served it as
an XHTML or XML application.</p>

<p>However the great rise of HTML 3.2 is probably some kind of mistake in my data-gathering
process, because last time the HTML 3.2 actually made a big fall, but now somehow it
has risen again, but there is still less HTML 3.2 now, then there was in the first survey.</p>

<h2 id="buggy-doctypes">Buggy doctypes</h2>

<p>The survey discovered a lot of mistakes made in the spelling of doctypes’
Formal Public Identifiers (FPI). Clearly, this indicates, that most of the
developers don’t really know what a doctype is – but here are the most common
mistakes made.</p>

<p>First of all, <strong>FPI is case-sensitive</strong>. A lot of developers
don’t seem to know that. A lot of pages had doctypes written entirely or
partly in lowercase (but also in uppercase). This is wrong. The bad examples follow:</p>

<pre>
-//w3c//dtd html 4.0 transitional//en 22
-//W3C//Dtd XHTML 1.1//EN
-//W3C//DTD HTML 3.2 FINAL//EN
-//W3C//DTD html 4.01 Transitional//EN
-//w3c//dtd html 4.0//en
-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.0 strict//EN
</pre>

<p>Secondly, <strong>the language identifier at the end of FPI refers to the language
the Document Type Definition itself is written in.</strong> All the W3C documents
are written in english, that’s why there’s "EN" at the end. But a lot of developers
thought this might be a place to specify the language of the HTML document. Wrong
again. Bad examples follow:</p>

<pre>
-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.0 Transitional//ET
-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.01 Transitional//ET
-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.0 Transitional//ET
-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.0 Transitional//EE
-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.1//EE
-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.0 Transitional//RU
-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.0 Transitional//RU
-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.0 Transitional//LT
-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.0 Transitional//LV
-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.0 Strict//NO
</pre>

<p>And lastly there were the misspelled FPI’s. Hard to say, why some people
write something like "XHTML 1.1 Transitional" without checking to see, if
a doctype like that even exists. More bad examples follow:</p>

<pre>
-//W3C//DTD HTML 5.0 Transitional//EN
-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.1 Transitional//EN
-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.01 Strict//EN
-//W3C//DTD HTML 3.02 Transitional//EN
-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.1 Transitional//EN
-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.0//EN
-//W3C//DTD HTM 4.0 Transitional//EN
-//W3C//DTD W3 HTML//EN
-//W3C//DTD 3.2//EN
-//W3C//DTD Transitional 1.0 Strict//EN
-//WC3//DTD HTML 4.0 Transitional//EN
</pre>




<h2 id="encodings">Encodings</h2>

<p>The number of pages, that specify encoding has risen from 72% to 73%.</p>

<p>As seen from <a href="#figure3">figure 3</a>, <strong>UTF-8 has made the most significant
rise and conquered the second place.</strong> ISO 8859-13 has risen from 10th place
to 8th.</p>

<p>There seems to be only good news this time:</p>

<li>A lot more valid pages!</li>
<li>A lot more XHTML!</li>
<li>A lot more UTF-8!</li>
</ul>

<p>Let’s hope the progress continues...</p>
