<h1>CSS Variables</h1>

<p>So finally we have variables in CSS. <a href="http://disruptive-innovations.com/zoo/cssvariables/">The spec</a>
was written by Daniel Glazman and David Hyatt and
<a href="http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-style/2008Jun/0230.html">WebKit has already implemented it</a>.</p>

<p>Adding variables to CSS has probably been one of the most
requested features. And although <a href="http://rip747.wordpress.com/2008/04/10/css3-css-variables-are-a-bad-idea-just-allow-us-to-call-other-selectors/">some people</a>
still seem to be against the whole idea, now we finally
have them implemented.</p>

<p>Of course you can now wonder of how long it would take
for IE to finally implement it. Given that IE8 already passes
Acid2, then maybe it won't even be that long to wait, but
even after that you still have to wait for years for all the
older browser version to fall out of mainstream use.</p>

<p>But this doesn't really bother me that much, because at the
meantime we can implement CSS variables on the server side,
<a href="http://interfacelab.com/variables-in-css-via-php/">like some have already done</a>.
Of course, this was already possible and done with all
kinds of different ways like mixing CSS with PHP or coming
up with some nifty new CSS syntax. But the pile of all those
different approaches was a big mess - now there is a standard,
that everyone can implement. Even better: once CSS variables
are available in your browser of choice, you can easily do most
of your development without having server-side transformation of
your CSS files, and only use the help of scripts when testing
in older browsers and when finally releasing to the public.</p>

<p>I at least, welcome CSS variables.</p>
